Words are useful, but what's more useful are the sentences and stories we build with them.
Similarly, while a lot of powerful, general tools are built into Python,
specialized tools built up from these basic units live in
[libraries]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#library)
that can be called upon when needed.

## Loading data into Python

To begin processing the wavedata, we need to load it into Python.
We can do that using a library called
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable "NumPy Documentation"), which stands for Numerical Python.
In general, you should use this library when you want to do fancy things with lots of numbers,
especially if you have matrices or arrays. To tell Python that we'd like to start using NumPy,
we need to [import]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#import) it:

~~~
import numpy
~~~
{: .language-python}

Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage locker and setting it
up on the bench. Libraries provide additional functionality to the basic Python package, much like
a new piece of equipment adds functionality to a lab space. Just like in the lab, importing too
many libraries can sometimes complicate and slow down your programs - so we only import what we
need for each program.

Once we've imported the library, we can ask the library to read our data file for us:

~~~
numpy.loadtxt(fname='wavesmonthly.csv', delimiter=',', skiprows=1)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
array([[1.979e+03, 1.000e+00, 3.788e+00],
       [1.979e+03, 2.000e+00, 3.768e+00],
       [1.979e+03, 3.000e+00, 4.774e+00],
       ...,
       [2.015e+03, 1.000e+01, 3.046e+00],
       [2.015e+03, 1.100e+01, 4.622e+00],
       [2.015e+03, 1.200e+01, 5.048e+00]])
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `numpy.loadtxt(...)` is a
[function call]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#function-call)
that asks Python to run the [function]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#function) `loadtxt` which
belongs to the `numpy` library.
The dot notation in Python is used most of all as an object attribute/property specifier or for invoking its method. `object.property` will give you the object.property value, `object_name.method()` will invoke on object_name method.

As an example, John Smith is the John that belongs to the Smith family.
We could use the dot notation to write his name `smith.john`,
just as `loadtxt` is a function that belongs to the `numpy` library.

`numpy.loadtxt` has two [parameters]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#parameter): the name of the file
we want to read and the [delimiter]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#delimiter) that separates values
on a line. These both need to be character strings
(or [strings]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#string) for short), so we put them in quotes. Notice
that we also had to tell NumPy to skip the first row, which contains the column titles. 

Since we haven't told it to do anything else with the function's output,
the [notebook]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#notebook) displays it.
In this case,
that output is the data we just loaded.
By default,
only a few rows and columns are shown
(with `...` to omit elements when displaying big arrays).
Note that, to save space when displaying NumPy arrays, Python does not show us trailing zeros,
so `1.0` becomes `1.`.

Our call to `numpy.loadtxt` read our file
but didn't save the data in memory.
To do that,
we need to assign the array to a variable. In a similar manner to how we assign a single
value to a variable, we can also assign an array of values to a variable using the same syntax.
Let's re-run `numpy.loadtxt` and save the returned data:

~~~
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='wavesmonthly.csv', delimiter=',', skiprows=1)
~~~
{: .language-python}

This statement doesn't produce any output because we've assigned the output to the variable `data`.
If we want to check that the data have been loaded,
we can print the variable's value:

~~~
print(data)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[[1.979e+03 1.000e+00 3.788e+00]
 [1.979e+03 2.000e+00 3.768e+00]
 [1.979e+03 3.000e+00 4.774e+00]
 ...
 [2.015e+03 1.000e+01 3.046e+00]
 [2.015e+03 1.100e+01 4.622e+00]
 [2.015e+03 1.200e+01 5.048e+00]]
~~~
{: .output}

Now that the data are in memory,
we can manipulate them.
First,
let's ask what [type]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#type) of thing `data` refers to:

~~~
print(type(data))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
~~~
{: .output}

The output tells us that `data` currently refers to an N-dimensional array, the functionality for which is provided by the NumPy library.
These data correspond to sea wave height. Each row is a monthly average, and the columns are their associated dates and values.

{: .callout}

With the following command, we can see the array's [shape]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#shape):

~~~
print(data.shape)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
(444, 3)
~~~
{: .output}

The output tells us that the `data` array variable contains 444 rows (sanity check:  37 years of 12 months = 37 * 12 = 444) and 3 columns
 (year, month, and datapoint). When we created the variable `data` to store our wave data, we did not only create the array; we also
created information about the array, called [members]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#member) or
attributes. This extra information describes `data` in the same way an adjective describes a noun.
`data.shape` is an attribute of `data` which describes the dimensions of `data`. We use the same
dotted notation for the attributes of variables that we use for the functions in libraries because
they have the same part-and-whole relationship.

If we want to get a single number from the array, we must provide an
[index]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#index) in square brackets after the variable name, just as we
do in math when referring to an element of a matrix.  Our wave data has two dimensions, so
we will need to use two indices to refer to one specific value:

~~~
print('first value in data:', data[0, 2])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
first value in data: 3.788
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
print('middle value in data:', data[222, 3])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
middle value in data: 2.446
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `data[222, 2]` accesses the element at row 222, column 2. While this expression may
not surprise you, using
 `data[0, 2]` to get the _3rd_ column in the _1st_ row might.
Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB and R start counting at 1
because that's what human beings have done for thousands of years.
Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0
because it represents an offset from the first value in the array (the second
value is offset by one index from the first value). This is closer to the way
that computers represent arrays (if you are interested in the historical
reasons behind counting indices from zero, you can read
[Mike Hoye's blog post](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/)).
As a result,
if we have an M×N array in Python,
its indices go from 0 to M-1 on the first axis
and 0 to N-1 on the second.
It takes a bit of getting used to,
but one way to remember the rule is that
the index is how many steps we have to take from the start to get the item we want.

!["data" is a 3 by 3 numpy array containing row 0: ['A', 'B', 'C'], row 1: ['D', 'E', 'F'], and
row 2: ['G', 'H', 'I']. Starting in the upper left hand corner, data[0, 0] = 'A', data[0, 1] = 'B',
data[0, 2] = 'C', data[1, 0] = 'D', data[1, 1] = 'E', data[1, 2] = 'F', data[2, 0] = 'G',
data[2, 1] = 'H', and data[2, 2] = 'I',
in the bottom right hand corner.](../fig/python-zero-index.svg)

{: .callout}

## Slicing data
An index like `[222, 2]` selects a single element of an array,
but we can select whole sections as well.
For example,
we can select the wavedata for the first year like this:

~~~
print(data[0:12, 0:3])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[[1.979e+03 1.000e+00 3.788e+00]
 [1.979e+03 2.000e+00 3.768e+00]
 [1.979e+03 3.000e+00 4.774e+00]
 [1.979e+03 4.000e+00 2.818e+00]
 [1.979e+03 5.000e+00 2.734e+00]
 [1.979e+03 6.000e+00 2.086e+00]
 [1.979e+03 7.000e+00 2.066e+00]
 [1.979e+03 8.000e+00 2.236e+00]
 [1.979e+03 9.000e+00 3.322e+00]
 [1.979e+03 1.000e+01 3.512e+00]
 [1.979e+03 1.100e+01 4.348e+00]
 [1.979e+03 1.200e+01 4.628e+00]]
~~~
{: .output}

The [slice]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#slice) `0:12` means, "Start at index 0 and go up to,
but not including, index 12". Again, the up-to-but-not-including takes a bit of getting used to,
but the rule is that the difference between the upper and lower bounds is the number of values in
the slice.

We don't have to start slices at 0:

~~~
print(data[12:24, 1:3])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[[ 1.     3.666]
 [ 2.     4.326]
 [ 3.     3.522]
 [ 4.     3.18 ]
 [ 5.     1.954]
 [ 6.     1.72 ]
 [ 7.     1.86 ]
 [ 8.     1.95 ]
 [ 9.     3.11 ]
 [10.     3.78 ]
 [11.     3.474]
 [12.     5.28 ]]
~~~
{: .output}

We also don't have to include the upper and lower bound on the slice.  If we don't include the lower
bound, Python uses 0 by default; if we don't include the upper, the slice runs to the end of the
axis, and if we don't include either (i.e., if we use ':' on its own), the slice includes
everything:

~~~
first_year = data[:12, 2:]
print('data from first year is:')
print(first_year)
~~~
{: .language-python}
The above example selects rows 0 through 11 and columns 2 through to the end of the array (which in this case is _only_ the last column).

~~~
data from first year is:
[[3.788]
 [3.768]
 [4.774]
 [2.818]
 [2.734]
 [2.086]
 [2.066]
 [2.236]
 [3.322]
 [3.512]
 [4.348]
 [4.628]]
~~~
{: .output}

## Analyzing data

NumPy has several useful functions that take an array as input to perform operations on its values.
If we want to find the average wave height for all months on
all years, for example, we can ask NumPy to compute `data`'s mean value:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
668.9611876876877
~~~
{: .output}

`mean` is a [function]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#function) that takes
an array as an [argument]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#argument). Given that our
array contains year and month information as well as data, taking the mean of the
whole array doesn't really make much sense - we don't expect to see 600 metre high waves!

We can use slicing to calculate the correct mean:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data[:,2]))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
3.383563063063063
~~~
{: .output}

{: .callout}

Let's use three other NumPy functions to get some descriptive values about the wave heights.
We'll also use multiple assignment,
a convenient Python feature that will enable us to do this all in one line.

~~~
maxval, minval, stdval = numpy.max(data[:,2]), numpy.min(data[:,2]), numpy.std(data[:,2])

print('Max wave height:', maxval)
print('Min wave height:', minval)
print('Wave height standard deviation:', stdval)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Here we've assigned the return value from `numpy.max(data[:,2])` to the variable `maxval`, the value
from `numpy.min(data[:,2])` to `minval`, and so on. Note that we used `maxval`, rather than just `max` - it's
not good practice to use variable names that are the same as [Python keywords](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords)
or fuction names.  

~~~
Max wave height: 6.956
Min wave height: 1.496
Wave height standard deviation: 1.1440155050316319

{: .callout}

What happens if the _shape_ of the data is not convenient for us to do some of our analysis? With this 
waveheight dataset, the data is a time-series, but it's not very easy to calculate things like
average monthly temperature. To do that, we'll need to _reshape_ it. `Numpy` allows us to do that 
relatively easily:

~~~
reshaped_data = numpy.reshape(d[:,2], [37,12]) # reshape the data to form a 2D array of year by month
~~~
{: .language-python}

We now have a 2D array of data using, where each row is a year, and each column represents a month:

~~~
print("The shape of the reshaped data is:")
print(reshaped_data.shape)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
The shape of the reshaped data is:
(37, 12)
~~~
{: .output}

We can verify that nothing about the data has changed:

~~~
print(f"The maximum value of the reshaped data is: {numpy.max(reshaped)}")
print(f"The minimum value of the reshaped data is: {numpy.min(reshaped)}")
print(f"The standard deviation of the reshaped data is: {numpy.std(reshaped)}")
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
The maximum value of the reshaped data is: 6.956
The minimum value of the reshaped data is: 1.496
The standard deviation of the reshaped data is: 1.1440155050316319

> still needs to be used
{: .callout}

We can now look variations in some summary statistics, such as the maximum wave height per month, or average height per year more easily. One way to do this is to create a new temporary array of the data we want, then ask it to do the calculation:

~~~
year_0 = reshaped_data[0,:] # 0 on the first axis (rows), everything on the second (columns)
print(f"maximum wave height for year 0: {numpy.max(year_0)}")
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
maximum wave height for year 0: 4.774
~~~
{: .output}

Everything in a line of code following the '#' symbol is a
[comment]({{ page.root }}/reference.html#comment) that is ignored by Python.
Comments allow programmers to leave explanatory notes for other
programmers or their future selves.

What if we need the maximum wave height for each month over all years (as in the
next diagram on the left) or the average for each day (as in the
diagram on the right)? As the diagram below shows, we want to perform the
operation across an axis:

![Per-year maximum height is computed row-wise across all columns using
numpy.max(data, axis=1). Per-year average wave height is computed column-wise across all rows using
numpy.mean(data, axis=0).](../fig/python-operations-across-axes.png)

To support this functionality,
most array functions allow us to specify the axis we want to work on.
If we ask for the average across axis 0 (rows in our 2D example),
we get:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(reshaped_data, axis=0))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[6.956 6.074 6.184 5.838 4.882 4.754 4.648 4.688 5.064 5.032 5.15  6.044]
~~~
{: .output}

As a quick check,
we can ask this array what its shape is:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0).shape)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
(12,)
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `(12,)` tells us we have an N×1 vector,
so this is the average wave height per month for all years.
If we average across axis 1 (columns in our 2D example), we get:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(reshaped_data, axis=1))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[3.34       3.15183333 3.29866667 3.53366667 3.448      3.23016667

 4.385     ]
~~~
{: .output}

which is the average wave height per month across all years.
